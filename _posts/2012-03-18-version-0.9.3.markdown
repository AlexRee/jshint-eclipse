The options for JSHint can now be shared among all projects in the workspace.
A new preference page "Options" has been added for the shared options.
It's still possible to have project-specific options, but (following the established
pattern in Eclipse) that's not the default anymore.

If you've already defined options for certain projects and want to keep them in the projects,
you'll have to check the new checkbox "Enable project specific settings" in the project's
property pages.
A full rebuild of the workspace is recommended after updating jshint-eclipse to ensure that all
markers are up-to-date: `Project > Clean... > Clean all projects`.

A [bug](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jshint-eclipse/issues/10) has been fixed that prevented
JSHint from succeeding and lead to annoying error messages.
