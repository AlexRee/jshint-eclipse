title: Coming soon â€¦ version 0.9.4
---

It has been quiet for some time, but the next version of jshin-eclipse is in the
works and will be published shortly.

JSHint 0.9.4 will provide a new way of selecting the files and folders to validate,
based on include and exclude patterns.

Of course, the built-in jshint will be updated to the newest jshint version r07.
A fix for a [bug](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jshint-eclipse/issues/13) that
prevented jshint-eclipse from running on Eclipse 3.6 is also included.
