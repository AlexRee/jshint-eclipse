This update introduces a new way of selecting the files and folders to
be validated, based on include and exclude patterns.
This allows for finer-grained control, e.g. including all `*.js` files
but excluding `*.min.js` files, or excluding files in a build target
folder.

The include and exclude patterns must be configured in the project's
properties, but a global preference page is planned for a future version.

The built-in jshint has been updated to the newest version r07.

A [bug](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jshint-eclipse/issues/13) that
prevented jshint-eclipse from running on Eclipse 3.6 has been fixed.
