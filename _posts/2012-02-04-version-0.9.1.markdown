To be able to run the JSHint checker headless from Java code, the plug-in has been split into a
core and a ui bundle. The core bundle has a simple API that can be used as follows:

    JSHint jshint = new JSHint();
    jshint.load();
    jshint.configure( new Configuration() );
    jshint.check( jsCode, new ProblemHandler() { ... } );

As a result, the ui plug-in's id has changed, so that configurations created with the previous
version have to be updated. The plug-in will do this automatically.

A problem with wrong marker positions when using tabs has been fixed.
