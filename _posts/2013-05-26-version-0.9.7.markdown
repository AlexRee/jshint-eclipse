title: Version 0.9.7 published
---

Just a minor update to fix the
[severe performance drop](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jshint-eclipse/issues/43)
that has been introduced in the recent version by including jshint 1.1.0.
The problem has been [fixed in jshint](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/958)
and the performance is back to normal.

A [bug](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jshint-eclipse/pull/30) that prevented
the plug-in from starting in Eclipse 3.6  has been fixed.

Builds can now be cancelled if they take too long.
Thanks [John](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jshint-eclipse/pull/35).

The built-in JSHint has been upgraded to version 2.1.2.
