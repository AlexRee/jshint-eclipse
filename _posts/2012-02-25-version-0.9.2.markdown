The JSHint Eclipse integration can now be used with a custom version of JSHint.
A preference page has been added that allows to select a `jshint.js` file from disk.
The original JSLint is also supported.

The built-in default library has been upgraded to the latest JSHint version (r06).

The Mozilla Rhino library is no longer contained in the core plug-in, but included as a separate
plug-in.
