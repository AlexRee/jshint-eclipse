This version adds support for
[non-boolean options](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jshint-eclipse/issues/25)
such as `indent`, `maxparams`, `maxdepth`, etc.

A [bug](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jshint-eclipse/issues/34) that caused a runtime exception
for certain input files has been fixed.

The built-in JSHint has been upgraded to version 1.1.0.
