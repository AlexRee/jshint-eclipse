Project specific configurations are now read from a `.jshintrc` file in the project root.
This allows to share configurations with other tools.

JSHint configuration files are simple JSON that contains options for JSHint and global variables.
Details on the format and available options can be found on the
[jshint pages](http://www.jshint.com/docs/config/).

This configuration format replaces the "options" and "globals" settings.
The JSHint property pages allow to edit the config files directly and initialize them with the
old project settings.

In order to support this configuration style, it was necessary to drop support for legacy JSLint.
