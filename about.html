    <h2>Features</h2>

    <p>
      This extension can be used to validate JavaScript files in Eclipse.
      Every problem found by JSHint is represented by a warning marker.
      The <em>Problems</em> view in Eclipse provides an overview of all
      problems found in a particular project.
    </p>
    <p>
      As usual in Eclipse, files are validated automatically when they change.

    <h2>Options</h2>

    <p>
      All <a href="http://www.jshint.com/docs/">configuration options</a>
      for JSHint can be specified on project level, i.e. for every project in
      the IDE, separate options can be defined.
      Settings are stored in the projects itself to be shared with the team.
    </p>
    <p>
      The configuration also allows to exclude certain files and folders from
      JSHint validation.
